<!-- Hi I'm Jayjtech. In this course, I will explain what HTML is, what it does and what it is used for -->

<!--

WHAT IS HTML? 
-- HTML: stands for HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE 

-- HYPER TEXT refers to the fact that HTML make it possible to click on links.
-- MARKUP LANGUAGE means that HTML is something you use to markup normal english text on the browser.
The entire WEB page uses HTML to tell the browser what to do with these text. 

-- INDEX.HTML
In every web application, we always start with index.html which is like an instruction manual for every website you load.

WHY IS INDEX.html SO IMPORTANT?
-- It serves as the default page for every web application.
-- Every website must have an index.html file because index is the name that the browser can read by default.

NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT HTML TAGS
-- An HTML tag is a tag name that is usually surrounded by a LESS THAN (<) and GREATER THAN (>) brackets
        
    Let's look at the examples of HTML tag

-- <html></html>: This wraps around the whole HTML script.
-- <head></head>: This tag take in-between it, the meta(hidden) datas that have to run before the page loads up.
-- <title></title>: Is meant to be an accurate and concised description of a page's content.
                    It is placed inside the <head> tag.
-- <body></body>: This tag covers all what we want to display on the page. All of our content goes inside the BODY tag

    ->The CONTAINER Elements
-- <div></div>: This serves as a container
-- <span></span>: This serves as a container
   
    ->The TEXT Elements
    We have the <h> tags, which spans from level 1 - 6. As the level increases from 1-6, the font size reduces.
    They are used for displaying PAGE TITLE. They are listed below:
-- <h1></h1>
-- <h1></h1>
-- <h2></h2>
-- <h3></h3>
-- <h4></h4>
-- <h5></h5>
-- <h6></h6>

-- <p></p>: Used for displaying TEXT PARAGRAPHS
    
    ->TAGS for LISTING items
-- <ol></ol>: It is called the ORDERED list, It is also called the numbered list i.e. 
              It displays by assiging every item in it a number in ascending order (1, 2, 3 ...).

-- <ul></ul>: It is called the UNORDERED list. It assigns a BALL POINT to every item in it.
-- <li></li>: We use the <li> inside both the Ordered and Unordered list.
    
    FOR EXAMPLE
    <ol>
        <li>Apple</li>
        <li>Mango</li>
        <li>Pineapple</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <li>Apple</li>
        <li>Mango</li>
        <li>Pineapple</li>
    </ul>

    ->ANCHOR TAG
-- <a href=""><a>: This is very important for navigation and requires an href attribute which
                    takes in the URL you want to redirect to.
    
    ->BUTTON
-- <button></button>: It can also be used as link, or given a specific function by adding JAVASCRIPT

    ->FORM TAG
-- <form></form>: With this, your website users can login, create posts or even make payments
                    We do that by wrapping the <form> tag aroung <input> elements.

    <input>: It's a self closing tag, mostly used for receiving data from users.

    ->IMAGE TAG
-- <img src="">: It is used to load image on the browser. An <img> tag requires a src attribute which stand for "SOURCE" to function.
                 The src="" attribute take in the URL of the image youwant to display on the browser
    

    ->ATTRIBUTES
        Attributes are used to add properties or modify an html element. Attribute goes inside the name tag.
        There are global attributes that can be added to an html element
        -- class, represented by a dot(.) in CSS
        -- id, represented by a hash(#) in CSS

        Other attributes are elemnt specific. We will look into that in the practical session (VIDEO).

    ->LANGUAGE TAGS
    -- <style></style>: CSS is written in between this tag
    -- <script></script>: JavaScript is written in between this tag

    And ofcourse, the three(3) languages (HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT) can be written in a single html file. But to keep things organized,
    It is always advisable to seperate them into their own dedicated file, then imported into the HTML file.
